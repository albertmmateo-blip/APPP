# User Guide - Appp Avisos

## Overview

Appp Avisos is a simple offline notes and reminders application for Android that helps you organize your notes into four categories:

- 📞 **Trucar** - Things to call about
- 📦 **Encarregar** - Items to order
- 🧾 **Factures** - Bills and invoices
- 📝 **Notes** - General notes

All your data is stored locally on your device, so the app works completely offline.

## Getting Started

### First Launch

When you first open the app, you'll see four tabs at the top representing each category. Since you haven't created any notes yet, each category will be empty.

### Main Screen

The main screen shows:

- Four tabs at the top (Trucar, Encarregar, Factures, Notes)
- A list of notes for the currently selected category
- A **+** button (floating action button) in the bottom-right corner to add new notes

## Creating a Note

1. Select the category tab where you want to add the note
2. Tap the **+** button in the bottom-right corner
3. Fill in the note details:
   - **Note Name** (required) - A short title for your note
   - **Note Body** (required) - The main content of your note
   - **Contact** (optional) - A person, phone number, or related contact
   - **Category** - Pre-selected based on your current tab, but you can change it
4. Tap **"SAVE"** to save the note

### Example: Creating a "Call Doctor" Note

1. Tap the **Trucar** tab
2. Tap the **+** button
3. Fill in:
   - **Note Name:** "Call Doctor"
   - **Note Body:** "Schedule annual checkup appointment"
   - **Contact:** "Dr. Smith - 555-1234"
   - **Category:** "Trucar" (already selected)
4. Tap **SAVE**

## Viewing Your Notes

Each note is displayed as a card showing:

- Note name (in bold)
- Note body (first two lines)
- Contact (if provided)
- Last modified date and time

Notes are automatically sorted by last modified date, with the most recent at the top.

## Editing a Note

1. Tap on any note in the list
2. The note edit screen will open with all the current information
3. Make your changes
4. Tap **"SAVE"** to save the changes

The "Modified" date will automatically update to reflect when you last changed the note.

## Deleting a Note

1. Tap on the note you want to delete
2. Tap the **"DELETE"** button
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears
4. The note will be permanently removed

⚠️ **Warning:** Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone!

## Switching Categories

Simply tap any of the four category tabs at the top:

- **Trucar** - For things you need to call about
- **Encarregar** - For items to order or pick up
- **Factures** - For bills, invoices, or payments
- **Notes** - For general notes and reminders

Each category has its own independent list of notes.

## Moving Notes Between Categories

1. Open the note you want to move
2. Tap the **Category** dropdown
3. Select a new category
4. Tap **"SAVE"**

The note will now appear in the new category instead of the old one.

## Understanding Dates

Each note tracks two dates:

- **Created:** When you first created the note (never changes)
- **Modified:** When you last edited the note (updates automatically)

Dates are displayed in the format: **DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM** (day/month/year hour:minute)

## Tips for Effective Use

### For Trucar (Calls)

- Use Contact field for phone numbers
- Include best time to call in the note body
- Example: "Call plumber - 555-9876, available 9-5"

### For Encarregar (Orders)

- List items to order in the note body
- Use Contact for store name or website
- Check off items as you order them

### For Factures (Bills)

- Note name: Bill name and due date
- Note body: Amount and payment details
- Contact: Company name and account number
- Delete after payment to keep list clean

### For Notes (General)

- Use for reminders, ideas, shopping lists
- Add contact for relevant person
- Review and clean up periodically

## Organizing Your Notes

### Keep names short and descriptive:

✅ **Good:** "Call dentist", "Buy groceries", "Pay electricity"

❌ **Too long:** "Remember to call the dentist office sometime next week"

### Use the body for details:

- Put all the details in the note body
- The name should just identify the note

### Delete completed items:

- Don't let old notes pile up
- Delete notes after they're no longer needed
- This keeps your lists manageable

## Offline Usage
